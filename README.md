# Using Wire

**Wire** – the pinnacle of secure instant messaging where privacy and security are not just features, but the foundation of every interaction. As you embark on your journey with Wire, remember that your anonymity is paramount. To maintain it, choose a username that reveals nothing about your personal identity. Think abstract – perhaps a combination of your favorite color and an animal, like "PurplePanda" or "RedFox". Random letters and numbers work well too, like “FYFK05042024”.

During the sign-up process, you may confidently use your actual email address; rest assured, only a select few employees at Wire have the capability to link your email to your chosen username. And even if your username were to be discovered, your conversations remain impenetrable, safeguarded by Wire's robust end-to-end encryption.

When setting up your Wire account, it's crucial to **avoid using a personal photo** for your user logo or image. This is an important step in preserving your anonymity. Instead, opt for something generic and non-identifiable, such as a landscape, an abstract design, or even the default avatar provided. Remember, every detail counts when it comes to maintaining your privacy. Stay vigilant and enjoy the secure communication that Wire offers.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always exercise caution: any message you send could potentially be read on the recipient's screen. Therefore, never disclose your real name, nor share images of yourself or your surroundings. Your vigilance is the final layer of security in ensuring your digital footprint remains anonymous. 

Once your account is created you can start a conversation with Kelvin by sending a message to @lilasrevenge 

> [!WARNING]
> Anyone communicating with me should assume someone else is always watching (or recording), so never disclose anything that can be traced back to you alone. Never share your name or anything else identifiable!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE WITH ME THAT CAN BE USED TO STOP A MURDER OR MASSACRE WILL BE USED TO DO SO. I will never disclose my source.
